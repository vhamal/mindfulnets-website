# Mindfulnets

Exercise your brain -- together.

## Installation

`npm install`

Create an `.env` file with contents:

```
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
PORT=3002
```

## Execution

- start the [backend](https://github.com/sedubois/mindfulnets-backend) locally
- `npm start`, then go to <http://localhost:3002/>.

## Development

For hot code reloading, execute `npm run dev` instead of `npm start`.

If you do still use `npm start`, make sure to execute `webpack` whenever static files are modified.
